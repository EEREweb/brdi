In the past they were viewed as an unusual group of bacteria and named archaebacteria but since the Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life, they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system. In this system the phylogenetically distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. Archaea are further divided into four recognized phyla, but many more phyla may exist.</p>
<p><strong>aromatic</strong>: A chemical that has a benzene ring in its molecular structure (benzene, toluene, xylene). Aromatic compounds have strong, characteristic odors.</p>
<p><strong>asexual reproduction</strong>: The naturally occurring ability of some plant species to reproduce asexually through seeds, meaning the embryos develop without a male gamete. This ensures the seeds will produce plants identical to the mother plant.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Residue remaining after ignition of a sample determined by a definite prescribed procedure. (Source: Domalski, E.S.; Milne T.A., ed. <em>Thermodynamic Data for Biomass Materials and Waste Components</em>.

The inner bark is a layer of living bark that separates the outer bark from the cambium and in a living tree is generally soft and moist. The outer bark is a layer of dead bark that forms the exterior surface of the tree stem. The outer bark is frequently dry and corky. (Source: Milne, T.A.; Brennan, A.H.; Glenn, B.H. <em>Sourcebook of Methods of Analysis for Biomass Conversion and Biomass Conversion Processes</em>. SERI/SP-220-3548.

<p><strong>biomass processing residues</strong>: Byproducts from processing all forms of biomass that have significant energy potential. For example, making solid wood products and pulp from logs produces bark, shavings and sawdust, and spent pulping liquors. Because these residues are already collected at the point of processing, they can be convenient and relatively inexpensive sources of biomass for energy.</p>
<p><strong>biopower</strong>: The use of biomass feedstock to produce electric power or heat through direct combustion of the feedstock, through gasification and then combustion of the resultant gas, or through other thermal conversion processes. Power is generated with engines, turbines, fuel cells, or other equipment.</p>
<p><strong>biorefinery</strong>: A facility that processes and converts biomass into value-added products.

<p><strong>carbohydrate</strong>: Organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and having approximately the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>; includes cellulosics, starches, and sugars. (Source: Milne, T.A.; Brennan, A.H.; Glenn, B.H. <em>Sourcebook of Methods of Analysis for Biomass Conversion and Biomass Conversion Processes</em>. SERI/SP-220-3548. Golden, CO: Solar Energy Research Institute, February 1990.)</p>
<p><strong>carbon dioxide</strong>: (CO<sub>2</sub>) A colorless, odorless gas produced by respiration and combustion of carbon-containing fuels. Plants use it as a food in the photosynthesis process.</p>
<p><strong>carbon monoxide</strong>: (CO) A colorless, odorless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete combustion.</p>

<p><strong>cellulase</strong>: A family of enzymes that break down cellulose into glucose molecules.</p>
<p><strong>cellulose</strong>: The carbohydrate that is the principal constituent of wood and other biomass and forms the structural framework of the wood cells. It is a polymer of glucose with a repeating unit of C6H10O5 strung together by &szlig;-glycosidic linkages. The &szlig;-linkages in cellulose form linear chains that are highly stable and resistant to chemical attack because of the high degree of hydrogen bonding that can occur between chains of cellulose (see below). Hydrogen bonding between cellulose chains makes the polymers more rigid, inhibiting the flexing of the molecules that must occur in the hydrolytic breaking of the glycosidic linkages. Hydrolysis can reduce cellulose to a cellobiose repeating unit, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, and ultimately to glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Heating values for cellulose may be slightly different based upon the feedstock. Example values are shown below (higher heating value [HHV] at 30<sup>o</sup>C, dry basis). (Source: Domalski, E.S.; Milne T.A., ed. <em>Thermodynamic Data for Biomass Materials and Waste Components</em>. The ASME Research Committee on Industrial and Municipal Wastes, New York: The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1987).</p>
<p><strong>Cetane (also called Hexadecane)</strong>:<strong> </strong>is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>. Hexadecane consists of a chain of 16 carbon atoms, with three hydrogen atoms bonded to the two end carbon atoms, and two hydrogens bonded to each of the 14 other carbon atoms. It has 10,359 constitutional isomers. Cetane is often used as a short-hand for cetane number, a measure of the detonation of diesel fuel. Cetane ignites very easily under compression; for this reason, it is assigned a cetane number of 100, and serves as a reference for other fuel mixtures.</p>
<p><strong>Cetane number (analogous to octane for gasoline)</strong>: Cetane number or CN is a measurement of the combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition. It is a significant expression of diesel fuel quality among a number of other measurements that determine overall diesel fuel quality.</p>

<p><strong>coarse materials</strong>: Wood residues suitable for chipping, such as slabs, edgings, and trimmings.</p>
<p><strong>combined cycle</strong>: Two or more generation processes in series or in parallel, configured to optimize the energy output of the system.</p>
<p><strong>combined-cycle power plant</strong>: The combination of a gas turbine and a steam turbine in an electric generation plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine provides the heat energy for the steam turbine.</p>
<p><strong>combined heat and power</strong>: (CHP) See co-generation.</p>
<p><strong>combustion</strong>: A chemical reaction between a fuel and oxygen that produces heat (and usually, light).</p>
<p><strong>combustion air</strong>: The air fed to a fire to provide oxygen for combustion of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>combustion efficiency</strong>: actual heat produced by combustion divided by total heat potential of the fuel consumed.</p>
<p><strong>commercial forest land</strong>: Forested land which is capable of producing new growth at a minimum rate of 20 cubic feet per acre/per year, excluding lands withdrawn from timber production by statute or administrative regulation.</p>
<p><strong>commercial species</strong>: Tree species suitable for industrial wood products.</p>
<p><strong>conifer</strong>: Tree, usually evergreen, with cones and needle-shaped or scale-like leaves, producing wood known commercially as softwood.</p>
<p><strong>conservation reserve program</strong>: CRP provides farm owners or operators with an annual per-acre rental payment and half the cost of establishing a permanent land cover, in exchange for retiring environmentally sensitive cropland from production for 10- to 15-years. In 1996, Congress reauthorized CRP for an additional round of contracts, limiting enrollment to 36.4 million acres at any time. The 2002 Farm Act increased the enrollment limit to 39 million acres. Producers can offer land for competitive bidding based on an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) during periodic signups, or can automatically enroll more limited acreages in practices such as riparian buffers, field windbreaks, and grass strips on a continuous basis. CRP is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).</p>

<p><strong>coproducts</strong>: The resulting substances and materials that accompany the production of a fuel product such as ethanol.</p>
<p><strong>cord</strong>: A stack of wood consisting of 128 cubic feet (3.62 cubic meters). A cord has standard dimensions of 4 x 4 x 8 feet, including air space and bark. One cord contains about 1.2 U.S. tons (oven-dry), i.e., 2,400 pounds or 1,089 kilograms (kg).</p>
<p><strong>corn stover</strong>: The refuse of a corn crop after the grain is harvested.</p>
<p><strong>cotton linters</strong>: HHV=7,497 BTU/lb (4,172.0 calories/gram (cal/g), 17426.4 Joules/gram (J/g)) wood pulp: HHV=7,509.6 BTU/lb (4165.0 cal/g, 17455.6 J/g) Linear chains of glucose linked by b-Glycosidic bonds comprise cellulose.</p>

<p><strong>cropland</strong>: Total cropland includes five components; cropland harvested, crop failure, cultivated summer fallow, cropland used only for pasture, and idle cropland.</p>
<p><strong>cropland used for crops</strong>: Cropland used for crops includes cropland harvested, crop failure, and cultivated summer fallow. Cropland harvested includes row crops and closely sown crops; hay and silage crops; tree fruits, small fruits, berries, and tree nuts; vegetables and melons; and miscellaneous other minor crops. In recent years, farmers have double-cropped about 4 percent of this acreage. Crop failure consists mainly of the acreage on which crops failed because of weather, insects, and diseases, but includes some land not harvested due to lack of labor, low market prices, or other factors. The acreage planted to cover and soil improvement crops not intended for harvest are excluded from crop failure and is considered idle. Cultivated summer fallow refers to cropland in sub-humid regions of the West cultivated for one or more seasons to control weeds and accumulate moisture before small grains are planted. This practice is optional in some areas, but it is a requirement for crop production in the drier cropland areas of the West. Other types of fallow, such as cropland planted to soil improvement crops but not harvested and cropland left idle all year, are not included in cultivated summer fallow but are included as idle cropland.</p>
<p><strong>cropland pasture</strong>: Land used for long-term crop rotation. However, some cropland pasture is marginal for crop uses and may remain in pasture indefinitely.
